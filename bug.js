This error typically occurs when using Expo's `expo start` command and involves issues with the Metro bundler, which handles JavaScript modules in React Native applications.  The root cause often lies in misconfigurations within the project's `package.json` file or dependencies that clash with Expo's internal mechanisms. For instance, using an incompatible version of React Native, React, or a specific library may lead to this cryptic error message. The `packager` may encounter difficulties processing modules or resolving dependencies. Another potential source of the error is incorrect project setup, such as missing or improperly defined configurations in files such as `babel.config.js` or `metro.config.js`.
