# Uncommon Expo CLI Metro Bundler Error

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error encountered when using the Expo CLI and its Metro bundler. The error message is often cryptic and doesn't provide much context for debugging.

## Problem

The `expo start` command fails to start the development server, throwing an error related to the Metro bundler's inability to resolve dependencies or process modules. This is often caused by a conflict between Expo's internal dependencies and those specified in your project's `package.json` or by misconfigurations in build settings.

## Solution

The solution involves systematically checking the following:

1. **Dependency Versions:** Ensure compatibility between Expo's version and the versions of React Native, React, and other relevant libraries.
2. **`package.json`:** Verify that all dependencies are correctly specified and there are no conflicting entries.
3. **Configuration Files:** Check `babel.config.js` and `metro.config.js` for any erroneous configurations that might interfere with the bundling process.
4. **Clean Install:** Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to resolve potential issues with package installations.
5. **Cache Clearing:** Try clearing the Metro cache by deleting the `.expo` and `node_modules` directories and reinstalling your packages.
6. **Expo Upgrade:** Upgrade Expo to the latest version using `expo upgrade`.
