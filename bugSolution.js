This solution focuses on systematically checking for dependency conflicts and configuration issues. First, ensure that all dependencies specified in your `package.json` file are compatible with your current version of Expo. Review the versions of `react-native`, `react`, and any third-party libraries you're using. Next, carefully examine `babel.config.js` and `metro.config.js` for any invalid configurations or settings.  Common issues involve incorrect paths or module resolution settings.  Try clearing the Metro bundler cache. Delete the `.expo` folder and the `node_modules` folder, and then reinstall your project's dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`.  If the problem persists, create a new Expo project to compare the configurations and identify any discrepancies.
